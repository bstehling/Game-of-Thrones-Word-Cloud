The purpose of this web application was to display the analysis of the names found in each of the books of the Game of Thrones series by George RR Martin. Show is the co-occurence of each of the major characters 
as well as a word cloud of the most commonly mentioned characters. Each are based on the book selected by the user and the co-occurence is based on the number of times characters appear in the same chapter together. 


Some interesting things found:

1. Co-Occurence Matrix: Story lines are formed individually then slowely blended

From the first book we see there are groups formed that show a strong distinction and a seperation from other groups. As we begin to see in the second and third book, those story lines of each group come more and more together as the stories begin connecting. Lastly, with the final two books the groups are much harder to find groups in as now all the stories are one large storyline.

2. Word Cloud: The last two books split the focus of the characters in two 

Some names begin to grow in frequency throughout the books just as some die down, changing the importance of the characters as the novels evolve. However, in the last two novels we see a major switch from the most common characters. This peaked curiosity amongst us and, after looking into the reason, we found the author split the conclusion of all the characters and their story lines in two. He wrote an explanation at the end of book 4 telling how he had so much to write about each characters conclusions that it needed to be broken in two books. The reason we see completely different highest frequency names in each book is because he "felt that the readers would be better served by a book that told all the story for half the characters, rather than half the story for all the characters."
