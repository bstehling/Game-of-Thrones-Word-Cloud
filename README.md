The purpose of this web application was to display the analysis of the names found in each of the books of the Game of Thrones series by George RR Martin. Show is the co-occurence of each of the major characters 
as well as a word cloud of the most commonly mentioned characters. Each are based on the book selected by the user and the co-occurence is based on the number of times characters appear in the same chapter together. 


Some interesting things found:

1. Story lines began to blend as the books went on

From the first book we see there are groups formed that show a strong distinction and a seperation from other groups. As we begin to see in the second and third book, those story lines of each group come more and more together as the stories begin connecting. Lastly, with the final two books the groups are much harder to find groups in as now all the stories are one large storyline.
